# SSZS
SS:ZS - A python project for players to record their adventures on the Unterzee in Sunless Sea.

This project is primarily a learning exercise. As my first attempt at learning Python I am working on this whenever my free time allows so progress may be slow. That said, once I have a working version, if anyone finds the stuff I produce useful then feature requests and feedback are more than welcome.

# Current State

Very rough GUI for entering data and writing to file exists.

# Next Steps

Create a naming scheme and proper filepaths to enable multiple entries to be stored.
Create a GUI to browse through stored entries and view them. Prettify both GUI's.

# Testing

As my time is limited I have elected to attempt to learn the testing framework at a later date and concerntrate on just producing something that functions for now.
