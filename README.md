# SSZS
SS:ZS - A python project for players to record their adventures on the Unterzee in Sunless Sea.

This project is primarily a learning exercise, as my first attempt at learning Python. I am working on this whenever my free time allows so progress may be slow. That said, once I have a working version, if anyone finds the stuff I produce useful then feature requests and feedback are more than welcome.

# Current State

I am currently working on the XML parsing to store information about each captain/voyage. Basical writer functionality exists.

# Next Steps

Researching and then creating working tests.

# Notes

As Java is/was my first language I am using the same naming conventions here. I am aware of PEPMy thinking being that I already use it so I'm sticking with it.
A lot of people seem to use mixedCase for Python.
snake_case_is_really_ugly.
