# SSZS
SS:ZS - A python project for players to record their adventures on the Unterzee in Sunless Sea.

This project is primarily a learning exercise, as my first attempt at learning Python. I am working on this whenever my free time allows so progress may be slow. That said, once I have a working version, if anyone finds the stuff I produce useful then feature requests and feedback are more than welcome.

# Current State

I am currently working on the XML parsing to store information about each captain/voyage. Basic writer functionality exists. (And on this branch, it is broken).

# Next Steps

Fixing the current AttributeError bug and merging with master
