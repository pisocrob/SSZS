# SSZS
SS:ZS - A python project for players to record their adventures on the Unterzee in Sunless Sea.

This project is primarily a learning exercise. As my first attempt at learning Python I am working on this whenever my free time allows so progress may be slow. That said, once I have a working version, if anyone finds the stuff I produce useful then feature requests and feedback are more than welcome.

# Current State


I am currently working on improving the interface and the view stories window.

# Next Steps

Adding more functionality to the GUI. Start looking at the more complex features such as reading Sunless Sea's save files for information about Captains.


# Testing

As my time is limited I have elected to attempt to learn the testing framework at a later date and concerntrate on just producing something that functions for now.
